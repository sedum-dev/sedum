Add `--reporter markdown`, which writes `report.md` for coding agents beside `result.json`. The report puts the most urgent failure first and gives its evidence and a rerun command. Frames now live in a new directory for each attempt, so concurrent runs and retries never overwrite or delete each other's evidence. The HTML and markdown reports share one sort order (failed, incomplete, flagged, passed) and print a score with extra digits whenever two decimals would misstate its comparison with a decision line.
